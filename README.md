# SMART-EYE (Automatic Vehicle Number Plate Detection)
The “SMART EYE” is a Python-based system designed to provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring and management of vehicles in various sectors like traffic management, law enforcement, parking management, transportation, toll plaza management. It features four primary modules: vehicle counting, speed detection, vehicle classification, and number plate detection. The vehicle counting module accurately counts the number of vehicles passing through a particular point and stores the data in an Excel sheet with the time and date. The speed detection module can detect the speed of vehicles and issue alerts if the speed limit is exceeded, providing a critical safety feature in school zones, residential areas, and busy intersections. The vehicle classification module can classify different types of vehicles and provide valuable insights into traffic patterns and volume. The number plate detection module can detect number plates and automatically store images to the number plates folder and converted text to excel sheet with time and date. The system operates on both live and recorded footage, making it suitable for various sectors, including traffic authorities, parking operators, and toll plaza management teams. It can also assist law enforcement agencies in investigating and solving crimes, making our communities safer. The data collected by the features can be stored in Excel sheets for further analysis and reporting, providing a valuable tool for optimizing road networks, public transportation routes, and parking facilities. Overall, the "SMART EYE" system has the potential to revolutionize the way we monitor and manage vehicle movements in various sectors, making it an essential asset in the modern world
